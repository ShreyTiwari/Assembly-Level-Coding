# Assembly-Level-Coding

This repository has a few assembly level codes wriiten using the arm instruction set.
The software used for executing the codes is named as 'The ARM Sim' created by University of Victoria.

There are three different difficulty levels:

  -> Difficulty_0 has codes with a lower difficulty level.
  -> Difficulty_1 has codes with an average difficulty level.
  -> Difficulty_2 has codes with a difficulty level above average.
  
Finally there is also a folder with a few codes devoted to testing the software interrupts and access the 
plugins that are offered by the app.
